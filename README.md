# Decoding Crime Patterns with Predictive Analytics

## Overview
This project harnesses predictive analytics to discern and anticipate crime patterns in Los Angeles, aiming to bolster public safety. It seeks to empower residents with essential, actionable insights about prospective criminal activities in their neighborhoods.

## Objectives
The key objective of this project is to fill the gap in public knowledge regarding local crime activities. By leveraging data analytics, the project aims to offer a proactive approach to community safety.

## Methodology
The approach involves a thorough analysis of crime data from the LAPD and environmental data from Visual Crossing. The methodology is grounded in combining these datasets and extracting meaningful patterns through advanced analytics.

## Data Description and Feature Engineering
An extensive dataset from the LAPD that includes various crime reports is used. This data is complemented with environmental factors obtained from Visual Crossing. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in preparing this data for predictive modeling.

## Model Selection and Rationale
For predicting crime patterns, decision trees, random forests, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used. These models were chosen for their effectiveness in handling complex and non-linear data structures, which are typical in crime data.

## Results and Conclusion
The project successfully highlights significant crime trends and potential hotspots. These insights demonstrate the potential of predictive analytics in aiding crime prevention and enhancing public safety. Future developments will focus on refining these models for more precise predictions.
